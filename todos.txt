TODOs:

1. Nussinov Algorithm:
1. a. (All) Double check nussinov implementation + backtrace, make sure it's the correct recursion
1. b. (Riya) Add min loop length req into algorithm

2. UI Modifications:
2. a. (Riya) Grey out bottom left triangle of cells (unused in nussinov algorithm)
2. b. (Riya) Highlight final number in a different color from other visited cells (will require changing return val in python file)
2. c. (Ellen) Label rows and columns of DP table to show what character it corresponds to
2. d. (Ellen) Add more CSS to make the DP and results grid look nicer/better spaced
2. e. (Ellen) (REACH GOAL, might be hard) --> add backpointer visualization so user can see exactly how DP table should be traced

3. Functionality Additions:
3. a. (Kavya) Supply real-life RNA samples (take from kaggle, we can potentially still provide the predicted secondary structure without showcasing the entire DP table for strings > 20 chars)
3. b. (Kavya) Import this library for secondary structure visualizaion (https://github.com/ViennaRNA/forna) --> YUH this is so cool and all we need to provide is string and dot-parenthesis notation

4. other
4. a. (Riya) Clean up read mes and make instructions very clear at top-level readME
4. b. (All) Presentation
4. c. (All) Report
